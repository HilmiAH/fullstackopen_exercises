User sends new note on Notes SPA:

- BreventDefault() stops normal form behavior from occuring
- Browser creates a new note object, and updates it's own notes array and displays it with redrawNotes()
- Browser then sendToServer(note)
// Note that browser doesn't refresh
browser->server: HTTP POST exampleapp/new_note_spa
server->browser: responds with json {message: "note created"}
